# Technical Assessment

This repository showcases my skills to a potential employer via a specific set of tasks outlined in the /tasks folder.

Each task corresponds to a development branch and each will be merged when they're all completed - roughly simulating an agile team working on separate tasks before submitting pull requests.

Don't forget to run 'npm i' and 'yarn install' before running 'yarn start'
