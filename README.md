# Technical Assessment

This repository showcases my skills to a potential employer via a specific set of tasks outlined in the /tasks folder.

Each task corresponds to a development branch and each will be merged when they're all completed - roughly simulating an agile team working on separate tasks before submitting pull requests.

Don't forget to run 'npm i' and 'yarn install' before running 'yarn start'

## Tasks:

1. Implement responsive design as per the sketch provided
(responsive-design branch)

2. Add ability to change quantity of item or remove item from Cart
(cart-enhance branch)

3. Integrate products from JSON endpoint
(product-api branch)

### Still to do:

Things I want to get done but may not have time for:

fix prop error
fix minor warnings
style the cart better
update the inventory in the store when removing item from cart
remove "your cart is empty" when items are in Cart
add "out of stock" for store items with less than 1 inventory
